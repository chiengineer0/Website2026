Most charging issues stem from under-planned electrical capacity. Before selecting hardware, evaluate panel headroom, daily mileage demand, and whether future vehicles are likely.

## Pro recommendation

Choose a smart Level 2 charger with load management when panel capacity is limited. It protects reliability while avoiding immediate service expansion.

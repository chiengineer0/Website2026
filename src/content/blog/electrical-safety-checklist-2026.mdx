A proactive inspection schedule is the fastest way to reduce electrical risk. Start with panel labeling accuracy, branch circuit loading, and AFCI/GFCI coverage in wet and sleeping areas.

## Priority inspection points

- Test GFCI and AFCI devices monthly.
- Confirm no warm outlets or breakers under normal load.
- Verify service panel has capacity headroom for new equipment.
- Replace damaged extension cords with permanent wiring solutions.
